\section*{Introduction}
\subsection*{Aim}
The aim of this project was to create interactive simulations to aid the teaching of the new Higher and Advanced Higher Physics Curriculum for Excellence courses.

\subsection*{Motivation}
Since the Curriculum for Excellence programme was implemented, there has been a demand for resources to aid in teaching the new elements of the Higher and Advanced Higher Physics curriculum.

\subsection*{Choice of topics}
The topics chosen for this project were:
\begin{itemize}
\item Special Relativity
\item Particle Accelerators
\item The Doppler Effect
\end{itemize}
These topics were all introduced with the Curriculum for excellence
program. The topics were chosen for this project from a
SUPA\textsuperscript{\cite{supa}} video competition with the same goal of creating more
resources for the new physics courses.

\subsection*{Practical considerations}
The tool used to create the simulations was a program called EjsS or
``Easy Java(Script) Simulations''. EjsS\textsuperscript{\cite{ejs}} is a tool created as a part of the Open Source Physics project. It is designed to make creating computer simulations easy for people such as science teachers and students who are otherwise unfamiliar with programming in Java or JavaScript.

This program was chosen so that simulations could be developed with
relative ease, and so that there is a no barrier to entry for someone
who wants to modify the simulations. Developing the simulations as
Java programs also meets the needs of physics teachers who cannot
access the internet while teaching to view Flash simulations or Java Applets.

\section*{The Simulations}
\subsubsection*{Topic: Our Dynamic Universe}
\subsubsection*{Subtopic: Special relativity}
The first simulation shows a pair of digital clocks. One relatively stationary in a lab, and the other travelling at a relativistic speed specified by the user. The observer is in the reference frame of the lab clock and can observe the slowing down of the moving clock.

\end{figure}

\subsection*{Analogue Clocks}
\subsubsection*{Topic: Our Dynamic Universe}
\subsubsection*{Subtopic: Special relativity}
The second simulation shows a pair of analogue clocks, one of which is
travelling at relativistic speeds. In this simulation, the observer is in the reference frame of the clock travelling at a relativistic speed specified by the user. The user can observe that the stationary clock speeds up as the velocity is increased.

\end{figure}

\subsection*{Photon Clocks}
\subsubsection*{Topic: Our Dynamic Universe}
\subsubsection*{Subtopic: Special relativity}
 This simulation shows a pair of model photon clocks, with a `photon'
 bouncing between two mirrors. The user is in the reference frame of
 the lab clock. As the user sets the speed of the moving clock, it
 begins to move across the window. At relativistic speeds, the motion
 of the photon appears to slow and the moving photon clock contracts
 in size due to time dilation. This simulation was inspired by a
 similar flash simulation developed by the King's Center for
 Visualisation in Science\textsuperscript{\cite{rocket}}.

\subsection*{Cyclotron}
\subsubsection*{Topic: Electromagnetism}
\subsubsection*{Subtopic: Particle Accelerators}
This simulation models a cyclotron particle accelerator which is
relevant to the electromagnetism section of the Advanced Higher
course. The user may set variables such as the strength of the
electric field, the charge of the particle, and the frequency of
oscillation of the electric field and the accelerator will apply the
Lorentz force accordingly. This simulation was inspired by a similar
Java Applet created by the National Taiwan Normal University\textsuperscript{\cite{cyclotron}}.

\subsection*{Doppler Effect}
\subsubsection*{Topic: Our Dynamic Universe}
\subsubsection*{Subtopic: The Expanding Universe}
This simulation demonstrates the concept of the doppler shift as well
as the concept of using spectroscopy on exoplanets. The simulation
consists of a model exoplanet which is orbiting a star. The planet is
being monitored using spectroscopy. The absorption lines are shown on
a spectrum of visible light at the bottom of the window. The user
chooses the angular velocity of the planet and star, and a Doppler
shift is applied to the spectral lines when the planet is moving
towards the observer or further away. This experiment was inspired by
a similar Flash simulation created by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln\textsuperscript{\cite{doppler}}.

\section*{Conclusion}
These simulations were produced during the limited time frame of the
project which was six weeks. Given more time, more of the
syllabus could be covered by such simulations.

All of the simulations produced in this project are open source and
available online\textsuperscript{\cite{repo}}. They can be easily used
or modified by anyone with the inclination.
